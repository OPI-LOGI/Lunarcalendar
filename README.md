##### MongoDB
is a document-oriented, non-relational database management system. It stores data in JSON-like documents with flexible schemas, making it easy to represent and store complex data structures. MongoDB is designed to handle large amounts of data and can be distributed across multiple servers for scalability and fault tolerance.

##### MongoDb Compass
is the official GUI tool provided by MongoDB. It offers a visual interface for interacting with MongoDB databases. With Compass, you can view and edit collections, create and execute queries, visualize data using charts, and manage indexes and user roles. Compass provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies working with MongoDB.
##### Mongoose
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, designed for Node.js applications. It provides a higher level of abstraction for interacting with MongoDB. With Mongoose, developers can define schemas, create models, and perform database operations using JavaScript. Mongoose simplifies the process of connecting to MongoDB, performing CRUD operations, enforcing data validation, and defining relationships between different collections.
